I	O
couldn't	O
imagine	O
what	O

``What	O

I	O
asked.	O

``It's	O

``There	O

staged	O
for	O

Siegel	B-PER
works	O
differently.	O

His	O
speech	O
is	O
clipped,	O
with	O
words	O
suddenly	O
hurried	O
or	O
inexplicably	O
dragged	O
out,	O
mumbled	O
or	O
swallowed:	O
aural	O
hooks,	O
the	O
equivalent	O
of	O
serifs	O
on	O
a	O
type	O
face,	O
except	O
that	O
serifs	O
don't	O
call	O
attention	O

themselves.	O

There's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
Dick	B-PER
Cavett	I-PER
in	O
Siegel	B-PER
's	O
interviewing	O
style.	O

He's	O
terribly	O
earnest,	O
while	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
suggesting	O
he's	O
not	O
very	O
interested.	O

He's	O
like	O
a	O
well-prepared	O

who	O
seems	O
never	O
to	O
ask	O
a	O
question	O
to	O
which	O
he	O
doesn't	O
already	O
know	O
the	O
answer.	O

It's	O
that	O
denial	O
of	O
the	O
chance	O
of	O
surprise	O
that	O
is	O
so	O
deadening.	O

There	O
is	O
nothing	O

least	O
of	O
all	O
anything	O
we	O
might	O
want	O
to	O
raise	O
our	O

over.	O

Perhaps	O
the	O
most	O
powerful	O
moment	O
of	O
news	O
reporting	O
I	O
ever	O
experienced	O
took	O
place	O
in	O
1978	B-DAT

On	O

on	O
his	O

and,	O
lowering	O
his	O
voice,	O
spoke	O
of	O
``this	O

He	O
broke	O
the	O
code	O

the	O

that	O
all	O

each	O

from	O

mostly	O
by	O

the	O

is	O
invariably	O

that	O
anything	O

anything	O

Ms.	O

characteristically	O
eager,	O

not	O

enthusiasm	O

also	O
experience	O
and	O
skepticism.	O

More	O
often	O
than	O
not,	O
people	O
are	O
on	O
her	O

to	O
sell	O
their	O

she	O
is	O
doing	O
the	O
show	O
to	O
bring	O
them,	O
and	O
what	O
they	O
are	O
writing	O
about,	O
to	O
life.	O

She	O
knows	O
how	O
to	O
let	O
people	O
talk;	O
she's	O
not	O
afraid	O
of	O
silences,	O
or	O
above	O
a	O
noisy	O
``Blech!''	O

when	O
she's	O
repulsed	O
by	O
a	O
creepy	O

She's	O
dogged;	O
she	O
can	O
give	O
the	O
impression	O
that	O
she	O
will	O
wait	O
around	O
all	B-DUR

every	O

question	O
with	O
some	O
variation	O
of	O
``That's	O

He	O
spoke	O
in	O
a	O
slow,	O
gravelly,	O
leering	O

about	O

the	O

The	O
real	O

is	O
whether	O

abroad.	O

Several	O
filmmakers	O
who	O
know	O
him	O
said	O
that	O
the	O
star	O
already	O
felt	O
trapped	O
by	O
his	O
romantic	O
image	O
among	O
teen-agers	O
and	O
viewed	O
himself	O
as	O
a	O
serious	O
actor	O
who	O
sought	O
roles	O
with	O
other	O
talented	O
actors	O
and	O
A-list	O
directors.	O

(His	O
only	O
other	O
forthcoming	O
role	O
is	O
in	O
a	O
new	O
Woody	B-PER
Allen	I-PER
project,	O
called	O
``Celebrity,''	O
to	O
be	O
released	O
later	O
this	O
year.)	O

What's	O
also	O
unusual	O
about	O
DiCaprio	B-PER
is	O
that	O
he	O
does	O
not	O
fall	O
within	O
the	O
tradition	O
of	O
rugged	O
classic	O
stars	O
like	O
Clark	B-PER
Gable	I-PER
,	O
or	O
romantic	O
heroes	O
like	O
Cary	B-PER
Grant	I-PER
,	O
or	O
archetypal	O
American	O
figures	O
like	O
James	B-PER
Stewart	I-PER
,	O
or	O
even	O
character	O
stars	O
like	O
Spencer	B-PER
Tracy	I-PER
,	O
James	B-PER
Cagney	I-PER
or	O
Humphrey	B-PER
Bogart	I-PER
.	O

Instead,	O
DiCaprio	B-PER
seems	O
to	O
most	O
resemble	O
Montgomery	B-PER
Clift	I-PER
and	O
James	B-PER
Dean	I-PER
,	O
whose	O
performances	O
were	O
marked	O
by	O
brooding	O
and	O
sensitive	O
roles	O
that	O
especially	O
appealed	O
to	O
teen-agers.	O

DiCaprio	B-PER
's	O
longevity	O
as	O
a	O
star	O
remains,	O
of	O
course,	O
unknown.	O

In	O
present-day	O
Hollywood	B-LOC
,	O
actors	O
are	O
heralded	O
as	O
stars,	O
mostly	O
by	O
the	O
publicity	O
machine,	O
but	O
then	O
fade.	O

Last	O
year	O
Vanity	B-ORG
Fair	I-ORG
hailed	O
Matthew	B-PER
McConaughey	I-PER
as	O
the	O
next	O
Paul	B-PER
Newman	I-PER
.	O

But	O
a	O
series	O
of	O
disappointing	O
films	O
have	O
dimmed	O
McConaughey	B-PER

stardom.	O

Matt	B-PER
Damon	I-PER
of	O
``Good	O

is	O
getting	O
a	O
similar	O
star	O
treatment	O
now.	O

Yet	O
DiCaprio	B-PER
is	O
seen,	O
somehow,	O
differently.	O

Since	O
his	O
teen-age	O
years,	O
he	O
has	O
been	O
a	O
sought-after	O
actor	O
in	O
Hollywood	B-LOC
and	O
viewed	O
as	O
a	O
performer	O
with	O
an	O
unusually	O
broad	O
acting	O
range.	O

``People	O
are	O
confusing	O

On	O

from	O
Geneva	B-LOC

the	O
director	O
expressed	O
his	O
surprise	O
at	O
the	O
reaction,	O
and	O
tried	O
to	O
explain	O
the	O
reason	O
behind	O
it.	O

``With	O
Wagner	B-PER
,	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
society	O
that's	O
very	O
closed,''	O
he	O
said.	O

``They	O
regard	O
`Lohengrin'	O
as	O
19th-century	B-DAT
romanticism	O
and	O
want	O
to	O
guard	O
it.''	O

He	O
made	O
it	O
clear	O
that	O
he	O
considered	O
Wagnerians	O
a	O
distinct	O
breed	O
of	O
classicists,	O
rigid	O
in	O
their	O
overprotectiveness.	O

Following	O
that	O
opening-night	O
performance	O
last	O
week,	O
the	O
audience	O
enthusiastically	O
applauded	O
each	O
of	O
the	O
leading	O
singers	O
and	O
James	B-PER
Levine	I-PER
,	O
who	O
had	O
conducted	O
the	O
orchestra.	O

Then	O
Levine	B-PER
brought	O
Wilson	B-PER
onstage,	O
and	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
sudden,	O
loud	O
chorus	O
of	O
boos,	O
echoing	O
through	O
the	O
opera	O
house.	O

Those	O
who	O
were	O
applauding	O
clapped	O
harder,	O
and	O
there	O
were	O
a	O
few	O
lonely	O
bravos.	O

But	O
the	O
jeers	O
resoundingly	O
outnumbered	O
the	O
cheers.	O

At	O
a	O
second	O
round	O
of	O
bows,	O
the	O
response	O
was	O
the	O
same.	O

For	O
the	O
third	O
round,	O
Wilson	B-PER
brought	O
his	O
costume	O
designer,	O
Frida	B-PER
Parmeggiani	I-PER
,	O
forward	O
with	O
him	O
(possibly	O
to	O
shield	O
himself	O
from	O
the	O
naysayers).	O

In	O
his	O
long	O
international	O
career	O
as	O
an	O
innovative	O
director	O
of	O
theater	O
and	O
opera,	O
Wilson	B-PER
has	O
always	O
stirred	O
the	O
strongest	O
reactions.	O

Especially	O
in	O
Europe	B-LOC

he	O
is	O
regarded	O
as	O
an	O
icon	O
of	O
experimental	O
theater,	O
greeted	O
with	O
appreciative	O
cries	O
of	O
``Bobwilson.''	O

He	O
is	O
certainly	O
accustomed	O
to	O
criticism,	O
in	O
public	O
and	O
in	O
print,	O
but	O
the	O
Met	B-ORG
reception	O
was	O
excessive	O
and	O
extraordinarily	O
rude.	O

It	O
was	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
committed	O
a	O
crime	O
against	O
the	O
audience.	O

Wilson	B-PER
said	O
that	O
standing	O
on	O
the	O
stage,	O
struck	O
by	O
a	O
wave	O
of	O
derision,	O
he	O
thought,	O
``Wow!''	O

wondering	O
what	O
had	O
provoked	O
such	O
a	O
visceral	O
response.	O

As	O
he	O
said:	O
``I	O
didn't	O
do	O
anything	O
so	O
radical.	O

I	O
didn't	O
ask	O
the	O
singers	O

sing	O
upside	O
down.''	O

What	O
he	O
did	O
was	O
to	O
strip	O
the	O
opera	O
of	O
its	O
romantic	O
trappings	O
and	O
present	O
it	O
in	O
an	O
abstract	O
modern	O
manner,	O
with	O
a	O
minimum	O
of	O
scenery	O
and	O
with	O
lighting	O
used	O
to	O
denote	O
both	O
environment	O
and	O
atmosphere.	O

Behind	O
the	O
singers,	O
a	O
shimmering	O
Rothko	B-PER
-like	O
rectangle	O
changed	O
color	O
according	O
to	O
mood	O
and,	O
in	O
Wilson	B-PER
's	O
signature	O
style,	O
bars	O
of	O
light,	O
both	O
horizontal	O
and	O
vertical,	O
were	O
substituted	O
for	O
traditional	O
woods	O
and	O
palaces.	O

Looking	O
back	O
at	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
the	O
project,	O
he	O
said	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
seen	O
a	O
photograph	O
of	O
a	O
production	O
of	O
``Hamlet''	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
ghost	O
was	O
an	O
ordinary	O
man	O
sitting	O
at	O
a	O
desk.	O

He	O
considered	O
the	O
possibility	O
of	O
staging	O
``Lohengrin''	O
in	O
a	O
similar	O
realistic	O
fashion.	O

Then,	O
inspired	O
by	O
Wagner	B-PER
's	O
own	O
drawings,	O
he	O
began	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
stage	O
space	O
in	O
abstract	O
terms.	O

Searching	O
for	O
the	O
architecture	O
of	O
that	O
space,	O
he	O
decided	O
to	O
frame	O
the	O
opera	O
with	O
lighting	O
and	O
to	O
present	O
it	O
``in	O
a	O
simple	O
way,	O
so	O
you	O
could	O
concentrate	O
on	O
the	O
music,''	O
while	O
knowing	O
that	O
``the	O
simplest	O
line	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
difficult.''	O

At	O
the	O
same	O
time,	O
he	O
retained	O
Wagner	B-PER
's	O
wing	O
of	O
a	O
swan	O
as	O
a	O
central	O
motif.	O

Because	O
of	O
the	O
work's	O
mythic	O
elements	O
and	O
outsize	O
emotions,	O
he	O
said,	O
it	O
could	O
easily	O
be	O
made	O
to	O
seem	O
ridiculous:	O
``If	O
I	O
did	O
the	O
opera	O
in	O
an	O
overly	O
theatrical	O
way,	O
that	O
would	O
diminish	O
the	O
music.''	O

Remembering	O
other	O
productions,	O
he	O
added,	O
``Often	O
the	O
music	O
is	O
diminished.''	O

At	O
all	O
costs,	O
he	O
wanted	O
to	O
help	O
the	O
Met	B-ORG
singers	O
feel	O
more	O
comfortable	O
on	O
stage	O
and	O
to	O
give	O
their	O
best	O
performances.	O

``I	O
was	O
trying	O
to	O
be	O
respectful	O
to	O
the	O
text,	O
the	O
story	O
and	O
Wagner	B-PER
,''	O
he	O
said.	O

``One	O
has	O
to	O
pay	O
respect	O
to	O
the	O
master,	O
but	O
one	O
has	O
to	O
be	O
careful	O
not	O
to	O
become	O
a	O
slave.''	O

He	O
said	O
that	O
a	O
classic	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
rooted	O
in	O
a	O
single	O
time	O
or	O
place:	O
``This	O
ancient	O

must	O
be	O
timeless.	O

must	O

that	O
in	O
contrast	O
to	O
the	O
opera	O
public,	O
theater	O

to	O
look	O
at	O
it	O

He	O

that	O

in	O
Wilson	B-PER
's	O
own	O
one-man	B-MEA

of	O
``Hamlet.''	O

With	O
equanimity,	O
he	O

interpretations	O
of	O

by	O

Whether	O

a	O

he	O
makes	O
bold	O

Occasionally	O
he	O
indulges	O
in	O
a	O

of	O

At	O
one	B-CAR

in	O

With	O

the	O

was	O
in	O
daring	O
to	O
direct	O
a	O
Wagnerian	O

at	O
the	O

It	O
seemed	O

that	O
no	O

what	O

would	O

the	O

He	O
indicated	O
that	O
he	O

``I	O

he	O

Even	O
to	O
such	O
an	O

``Maybe	O

``To	O

So	O
writes	O
Thomas	B-PER
Cahill	I-PER
in	O
his	O
captivating	O
new	O
book,	O
``The	O
Gifts	O
of	O
the	O
Jews,''	O
a	O
sequel	O
to	O
the	O
author's	O
best-selling	O
``How	O
the	O
Irish	O
Saved	O
Civilization''	O
and	O
the	O
second	O
book	O
in	O
his	O
projected	O
seven-volume	B-MEA
``Hinges	O
of	O
History''	O
series,	O
about	O
``the	O
great	O
gift-givers''	O
who	O
shaped	O
Western	O
civilization.	O

``Though	O
the	O
Bible	O
is	O
full	O
of	O
literature's	O
two	B-CAR
great	O
themes,	O
love	O
and	O
death	O
(as	O
well	O
as	O
its	O
exciting	O
caricatures,	O
sex	O
and	O
violence),''	O
Cahill	B-PER
continues,	O
``it	O
is	O
also	O
full	O
of	O
tedious	O
ritual	O
prescriptions	O
and	O
interminable	O
battles.	O

More	O
than	O
anything,	O
because	O
the	O
Bible	O
is	O
the	O
product	O
of	O
so	O
many	O
hands	O
over	O
so	O
many	O
ages,	O
it	O
is	O
full	O
of	O
confusion	O
for	O
the	O
modern	O
reader	O
who	O
attempts	O
to	O
decode	O
what	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
about.''	O

So	O
he	O
decodes	O
it	O
for	O
us,	O
the	O
Hebrew	O
Bible,	O
that	O
is,	O
comprising	O
Torah	O
(or	O
Teaching),	O
Neviim	O
(or	O
Prophets)	O
and	O
Ketuvim	O
(or	O
Writings).	O

The	O
former	O
director	O
of	O
religious	O
publishing	O
at	O
Doubleday	B-ORG
,	O
Cahill	B-PER
skips	O
over	O
the	O
boring	O
parts	O
or	O
summarizes	O
their	O
implications;	O
he	O
skirts	O
much	O
scholarly	O
controversy;	O
he	O
simplifies	O
``complex	O
questions	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
line	O
of	O
my	O
argument	O
may	O
appear	O
clearly;''	O
he	O
writes	O
in	O
an	O
easy,	O
relaxed	O
vernacular.	O

And	O
he	O
enjoys	O
himself.	O

He	O
laughs	O
at	O
the	O
pharaoh	O
who	O
asks,	O
``Ma-zot?''	O

(``What's	O
this?''),	O
``an	O
almost	O
comic	O
exclamation	O
of	O
frustration	O
often	O
heard	O
in	O
modern	O
Israel	B-LOC
,''	O
when	O
he	O
learns	O
that	O
Sarah	B-PER
(in	O
Genesis)	O
is	O
actually	O
not	O
Abraham	B-PER
's	O
sister	O
but	O
his	O
wife.	O

He	O
delights	O
in	O
the	O
accessibility	O
of	O
David	B-PER
's	O
character:	O
``He	O
is	O
the	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
football	O
team,	O
the	O
supersalesman,	O
the	O
engaging	O
entertainer,	O
the	O
charismatic	O
politician.	O

We	O
know	O
the	O
man.''	O

He	O
quotes	O
in	O
full	O
the	O
beautiful	O
King	O
James	O
Version	O
of	O
the	O
23rd	O
Psalm,	O
even	O
though	O
much	O
of	O
the	O
English-speaking	O
world	O
probably	O
knows	O
it	O
by	O
heart.	O

So	O
the	O
reader	O
enjoys	O
himself,	O
too,	O
happy	O
to	O
have	O
gaps	O
filled	O
in,	O
amused	O
to	O
read	O
the	O
author's	O
snappy	O
summaries	O
of	O
obscure	O
occurrences,	O
edified	O
by	O
his	O
straightforward	O
interpretations	O
of	O
much-debated	O
episodes.	O

But,	O
as	O
his	O
subtitle	O
conveys,	O
``How	O
a	O
Tribe	O
of	O
Desert	O
Nomads	O
Change	O
the	O
Way	O
Everyone	O
Thinks	O
and	O
Feels,''	O
Cahill	B-PER
has	O
a	O
much	O
larger	O
purpose	O
here	O
than	O
simply	O
to	O
entertain.	O

What	O
he	O
sets	O
out	O
to	O
make	O
clear	O
is	O
that	O
when	O
Abraham	B-PER
in	O
Genesis	O
heard	O
a	O
voice	O
telling	O
him	O
``Go-you-forth/from	O
your	O
land,/from	O
your	O
kindred,/from	O
your	O
father's	O
house,/to	O
the	O
land	O
that	O
I	O
will	O
let	O
you	O
see,''	O
something	O
new	O
in	O
history	O
was	O
happening,	O
``a	O
migration	O
in	O
the	O
wrong	O
direction''	O
that	O
``would	O
change	O
the	O
face	O
of	O
the	O
earth	B-LOC
.''	O

So	O
in	O
his	O
reading	O
of	O
the	O
Hebrew	O
Bible	O
he	O
not	O
only	O
traces	O
the	O
development	O
of	O
the	O
Hebrew	O
God	B-PER
from	O
the	O
figure	O
who	O
heavy-handedly	O
called	O
for	O
the	O
near-sacrifice	O
of	O
Isaac	B-PER
because	O
``He	O
had	O
to	O
jump-start	O
this	O
new	O
religion,	O
and	O
He	O
didn't	O
always	O
have	O
the	O
best	O
material	O

with,''	O
to	O
what	O
the	O
King	O
James	O
calls	O
the	O
``still,	O
small	O
voice''	O
that	O
the	O
Prophet	O
Elijah	B-PER
heard.	O

Cahill	B-PER
also	O
contrasts	O
this	O
development	O
with	O
what	O
existed	O
before	O
Abraham	B-PER
's	O
departure	O
for	O
Canaan	B-LOC
,	O
namely	O
what	O
the	O
author	O
describes	O
as	O
the	O
static	O
outlook	O
of	O
the	O
Mesopotamian	O
kingdom	O
of	O
Sumer	B-LOC
around	O

B.C.	I-DAT

,	O
which	O
conceived	O
of	O
time	O
as	O
a	O
turning	O
wheel	O
without	O
beginning	O
or	O
end.	O

This	O
section	O
on	O
Sumer	B-LOC
is	O
the	O
most	O
speculative	O
in	O
Cahill	B-PER
's	O
book.	O

By	O
offering	O
up	O
``Gilgamesh''	O
as	O
an	O
epic	O
without	O
much	O
dramatic	O
development,	O
and	O
by	O
imagining	O
an	O
eerie	O
Moon	B-LOC
-cult	O
ritual	O
in	O
which	O
a	O
priestess	O
mounts	O
an	O
adolescent	O
boy,	O
he	O
is	O
more	O
or	O
less	O
asking	O
us	O
to	O
take	O
his	O
word	O
(and	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
pre-eminent	O
modern	O
scholar	O
of	O
religion,	O
Mircea	B-PER
Eliade	I-PER
)	O
that	O
the	O
Sumerians	O
lacked	O
any	O
sense	O
of	O
history.	O

But	O
the	O
timeless	O
atmosphere	O
he	O
evokes	O
certainly	O
contrasts	O
vividly	O
with	O
the	O
sharpness	O
of	O
the	O
Hebrew	O
imperative	O
``lekh-lekha''	O
(``Go	O
forth'')	O
and	O
the	O
phrase	O
``wayyelekh	O
Avram	B-PER
''	O
(``	O
Abraham	B-PER
went''),	O
which	O
Cahill	B-PER
calls	O
``	O
two	B-CAR
of	O
the	O
boldest	O
words	O
in	O
all	O
of	O
literature.''	O

And	O
what	O
matters,	O
after	O
all,	O
are	O
the	O
events	O
after	O
Abraham	B-PER
's	O
departure.	O

Does	O
the	O
thesis	O
of	O
``The	O
Gifts	O
of	O
the	O
Jews''	O
stand	O
up,	O
persuading	O
us	O
that	O
the	O
Israelites	O
changed	O
history?	O

As	O
readers	O
of	O
``How	O
the	O
Irish	O
Saved	O
Civilization''	O
will	O
recall,	O
Cahill	B-PER
is	O
fond	O
of	O
hyperbole.	O

So	O
one	O
might	O
take	O
it	O
with	O
a	O
grain	O
of	O
salt	O
when	O
he	O
writes	O
of	O
the	O
Old	O
Testament	O
Jews	O
that	O
``it	O
may	O
be	O
said	O
with	O
some	O
justice	O
that	O
theirs	O
is	O
the	O
only	O
new	O
idea	O
that	O
human	O
beings	O
have	O
ever	O
had,''	O
or	O
``We	O
can	O
hardly	O
get	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
or	O
cross	O
the	O
street	O
without	O
being	O
Jewish.''	O

Then,	O
too,	O
he	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
chiding	O
anti-Semites,	O
of	O
whom	O
he	O
writes:	O
``The	O
hatred	O
of	O
Christians	O
for	O
Jews	O
may	O
have	O
its	O
ultimate	O
source	O
in	O
hatred	O
of	O
God	B-PER
,	O
a	O
hatred	O
that	O
the	O
hater	O
must	O
carefully	O
keep	O
himself	O
from	O
knowing	O
about.''	O

Yet	O
``The	O
Gifts	O
of	O
the	O
Jews''	O
is	O
finally	O
persuasive	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
entertaining.	O

``Where	O
are	O
the	O
Sumerians,	O
the	O
Babylonians,	O
the	O
Assyrians	O
today?''	O

he	O
asks,	O
remarking	O
on	O
Jewish	O
identity	O
and	O
the	O
``unique	O
miracle	O
of	O
cultural	O
survival.''	O

``The	O
