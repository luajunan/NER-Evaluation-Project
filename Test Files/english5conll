did	O

but	O
it	O
had	O
an	O
unexpected	O
side	O

some	O
men	O
taking	O

found	O
that	O
it	O
resulted	O
in	O
prolonged	O
or	O

When	O
Pfizer	B-ORG
scientists	O
decided	O
to	O
investigate	O
its	O
usefulness	O
as	O
an	O
impotence	O
remedy,	O
they	O
had	O
to	O
learn	O
about	O
the	O
biochemistry	O

neurobiology	O
of	O
erections.	O

They	O
also	O
had	O
to	O

developing	O
a	O
survey	O
to	O
determine	O
whether	O
erections,	O
sexual	O
performance	O

improved	O
and,	O
if	O
so,	O
by	O
how	O
much.	O

Now	O
many	O
doctors	O
want	O
to	O
know	O
whether	O
Viagra	O
works	O
on	O
women,	O
since	O
the	O
clitoris	O
is	O
the	O
female	O

and	O
thus	O
becomes	O
engorged	O
with	O
blood	O
during	O
sexual	O
arousal.	O

But	O
how,	O
they	O
ask,	O
should	O
they	O
measure	O
arousal	O
in	O
women,	O
especially	O
since	O
relatively	O
little	O

Pfizer	B-ORG

about	O
the	O

But	O
even	O
asking	O
about	O

Since	O

Alvin	B-PER

``Initially,	O

had	O
substantial	O

some	O
very	O
good	O

he	O
said.	O

``However,	O
I	O

the	O

It	O
involves	O

that	O
Jeter	B-PER

the	O
number	O

outs	O

Torre	B-PER
said	O
he	O
thought	O
Williams	B-PER
'	O
liner	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
land	O
for	O
a	O
hit.	O

Jeter	B-PER
said	O
he	O
did,	O
too.	O

``I	O
was	O
thinking	O
`score,'	O
even	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
hit	O
hard,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
trying	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
good	O
jump,''	O
Jeter	B-PER
said.	O

``	O
Edmonds	B-PER
caught	O
it	O
like	O
he	O
was	O
camped	O
under	O
a	O
fly	O
ball.''	O

Anaheim	B-LOC
scored	O
three	B-CAR
runs	O
in	O
the	O
fourth	O
inning	O
against	O
David	B-PER
Wells	I-PER
,	O
but	O
if	O
the	O
Yankee	B-ORG
infielders	O
had	O
made	O
the	O
plays,	O
the	O
damage	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
limited	O
to	O
one	B-CAR
run.	O

One	B-CAR
out	O
into	O
the	O
inning,	O
Dave	B-PER
Hollins	I-PER
hammered	O
a	O
solo	O
homer.	O

Then	O
Tim	B-PER
Salmon	I-PER
chopped	O
a	O
ball	O
into	O
the	O
shortstop	O
hole,	O
where	O
Jeter	B-PER
fielded	O
it	O
and	O
fired	O
toward	O
first.	O

The	O
throw	O
skipped	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
first	O
baseman	O
Tino	B-PER
Martinez	I-PER
,	O
who	O
was	O
unable	O
to	O
scoop	O
the	O
ball	O
cleanly.	O

Base	O
hit.	O

After	O
Wells	B-PER
walked	O
Cecil	B-PER
Fielder	I-PER
,	O
the	O
swift	O
Garret	B-PER
Anderson	I-PER
slapped	O
a	O
half-speed	B-MEA
grounder	O
up	O
the	O
middle.	O

The	O
chances	O
of	O
an	O
inning-ending	O
double	O
play	O
were	O
marginal,	O
but	O
any	O
shot	O
was	O
lost	O
when	O
Jeter	B-PER
fumbled	O
the	O
bouncer	O
and	O
settled	O
for	O
the	O
out	O
at	O
first.	O

Instead	O
of	O
being	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
inning,	O
Wells	B-PER
had	O
to	O
pitch	O
to	O
Phil	B-PER
Nevin	I-PER
with	O
two	B-CAR
runners	O
on	O
and	O
two	B-CAR
out,	O
and	O
he	O
gave	O
up	O
a	O
two-run	B-MEA
double.	O

``That	O
was	O
tough,''	O
Jeter	B-PER
said	O
of	O
Anderson	B-PER
's	O
ball.	O

``He	O
hit	O
it	O
slow.''	O

But	O
Wells	B-PER
accepted	O
his	O
share	O
of	O
the	O
blame	O
for	O
the	O
three	B-CAR
runs;	O
he	O
threw	O
a	O
fastball	O
with	O
no	O
balls	O
and	O
two	B-CAR
strikes	O
to	O
Hollins	B-PER
for	O
the	O
home	O
run	O
and	O
a	O
hanging	O
curveball	O
for	O
Nevin	B-PER
's	O
double.	O

Darryl	B-PER
Strawberry	I-PER
and	O
Williams	B-PER
played	O
alongside	O
each	O
other	O
in	O
spring	B-DAT
training	O
without	O
having	O
one	B-CAR
ball	O
hit	O
equidistant	O
between	O
them.	O

This	O
occurred	O
twice	O
Thursday	B-DAT
,	O
with	O
Strawberry	B-PER
catching	O
the	O
first	O
ball	O
and	O
dropping	O
the	O
second,	O
as	O
he	O
avoided	O
collisions	O
with	O
Williams	B-PER
.	O

Strawberry	B-PER
's	O
second	O
play	O
was	O
ruled	O
a	O
triple	O
by	O
Gary	B-PER
DiSarcina	I-PER
,	O
setting	O
up	O
a	O
two-run	B-MEA
seventh.	O

In	O
the	O
eighth,	O
Scott	B-PER
Brosius	I-PER
,	O
the	O
third	O
baseman,	O
fielded	O
a	O
grounder	O
with	O
runners	O
at	O
first	O
and	O
third	O
and	O
the	O
infield	O
in.	O

Brosius	B-PER
glanced	O
at	O
Carlos	B-PER
Garcia	I-PER
,	O
the	O
runner	O
at	O
third,	O
before	O
looking	O
to	O
second;	O
Brosius	B-PER
had	O
forgotten	O
that	O
second	O
baseman	O
Chuck	B-PER
Knoblauch	I-PER
would	O
not	O
be	O
covering	O
the	O
base	O
with	O
the	O
infield	O
in.	O

So	O
Brosius	B-PER
quickly	O
threw	O
to	O
first.	O

Garcia	B-PER
noted	O
Brosius	B-PER
'	O
indecision	O
and	O
scored.	O

As	O
the	O
infielders	O
reset	O
for	O
the	O
next	O
hitter,	O
Brosius	B-PER
tapped	O
his	O
chest,	O
acknowledging	O
his	O
mistake.	O

Later,	O
Strawberry	B-PER
overthrew	O
a	O
cutoff	O
man.	O

``Hopefully,	O
we	O
got	O
all	O
